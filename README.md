# CircuitPython

# LED Blink

### What I learned
* I learned how to create a document in MU Editor.
	* To run a document, it must be named either main.py or code.py. 
* I learned how to import libraries in Circuit Python
	* You write import and then the library's name at the top of your file.

# Servo

### What I learnned
* I learned how to troubleshoot with friends.
	* I had never used a PWM pin before so I asked my friend Lucas Fuller for some help. He explained it and I implemented it into my code
* I learned what Capacitive Touch is.
	* Capacitive Touch allow you, in this case, to control a servo with your fingers.

# LCD

### What I learnned
* I learned how to use a LCD with CircuitPython.
        * I learned to wire it up and figure out which libraries to use.
* I expanded my knowledge on Capacitive touch.
* I learned how to use the internet to figure out coding problems.

We connected wires to this backpack with connected them to the LCD. This made the process a lot simpler.
